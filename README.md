Static Circular Linked list and Double Linked List: Implemented using the basic (Insert, Delete, Update, dispaly, Search) Operations of linked list. In Insert operations you can notice three different functions, wherein, user can insert an element at the begining of the list, at the end of the list and also you can find sorted insert by value - inserting into sorted linked list based on the value. Similar opaerations can be found in deleting. You can even search a particular element and display all the elements of the linked list.

Dynamic Student Catalog System: Implemented using Linked List, it gives a simple example of a complete system with the functionality wherein, user can add a record, search record, Update record and delete record and display all records.The menu is handled by if else statement. While adding a new record, if any node already exist then new node is connected with it otherwise a new node is created. While searching a node, a pointer searches all the pointers of linked lists to match the required data from start to end. While Modification the data part of the linked list is overwritten with new data and in case of Deletion, the pointers before and after of the node which we need to delete are connected with each other.
